<h1>Student Panel</h1>
<h4>Thursday at 4:30pm: <a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/94729448892">Zoom Link</a></h4>

<b>Ask questions live or in advance: <a href="https://app.sli.do/event/kEVby5SNMiMyX9o5VY2ouq/live/questions">Slido</a></b>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>
The goal of the student panel is to answer any and all questions or concerns
you may have about non-research specific topics (Similar to the questions that
have been already posted on our Visit Day slack channel). These questions can
be broadly about topics such as housing, program structure/coursework, funding,
student life, support system (including physical and mental health), or any
other things you may have queries about/want to discuss. The panel consists of
current senior and junior PhD students, with <b>no faculty or staff in attendance,
	and no recording of the event</b>. Feel completely free to bring up any
question/concern that you might think of.



<p>We have two ways to post questions before/during the session:
Before the session, we will use this <a href="https://app.sli.do/event/kEVby5SNMiMyX9o5VY2ouq/live/questions">Slido forum to post questions</a>.
During the session we will still continue to use Slido preferably, but you can also post your questions to the panelists using the Zoom chat.

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to to the organizer Jennifer Chien: &lt;<a href="mailto:jjchien@eng.ucsd.edu">jjchien@eng.ucsd.edu</a>&gt;

The link to the slides will be shared after the session. Looking forward to meeting you!!!
